Add new PresentmentDetails class with the following provided in the initializer:

/*
ShopperInsightsClient.sendPayPalPresentedEvent
ShopperInsightsClient.sendVenmoPresentedEvent

Update the signature for sendPayPalPresentedEvent and sendVenmoPresentedEvent to sendPresentedEvent(for buttonType: BTButtonType, presentmentDetails: BTPresentmentDetails) - if this naming doesnâ€™t translate well to Android use whatever pattern is best for this Android wise!
Verify that the above is being passed to FPTI as expected (verify with Arpan)
As needed update demo app
Open a PR with the above changes
