## Adding It To Your Project

The features of the Braintree SDK are organized into modules that can be imported as dependencies in your `build.gradle` file.
See the [Migration Guide](v5_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for specific dependencies required for each module.

For an integration offering card payments, add the following dependency in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.braintreepayments.api:card:5.0.0-beta2'
}
```

To preview the latest work in progress builds, add the following SNAPSHOT dependency in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.braintreepayments.api:card:5.0.0-beta2-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

You will also need to add the Sonatype snapshots repo to your top-level `build.gradle` to import SNAPSHOT builds:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
        }
    }
}
```
